    "## Bernoulli Distributions\n",
    "Let's examine a couple of discrete random variables that interest us. The first one is the Bernoulli distribution, named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli. \n",
    "* __Bernoulli distribution__: A Bernoulli distribution models the probability of occurrence of a discrete binary event, for example, the outcome of a coin toss, i.e., whether we see heads or whether a stock price will increase or decrease tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bernoulli random variable $X$ models a binary outcome: either `0` or `1`, \n",
    "where `1` occurs with probability $p$ and `0` occurs with probability $1-p$. \n",
    "The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli random variable $X$ is:\n",

    "p_{X}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "    p & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n",

    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $0<p<1$ is called the Bernoulli parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __What is an outcome of `0` or `1`__? One thing that throws students is the X is defined as either a zero or a one. Remember, X can be considered the outcome of a condition that evaluates to zero or one, such as an independent Boolean experiment.  So the statement, my coin flip equals heads, will be evaluated as `true` when we see a head ($X$ will equal `1`), and $X$ equals zero for the `false` case, e.g., when we see tails.\n",
