    "## Binomial Lattice Model\n",
    " A binomial lattice model assumes that at each discrete time increment, the future state of the system, e.g., the share price of equity, can either increase by a factor $u$ with probability $p$ or decrease by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ in the next time interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we start today (the blue node), a binomial lattice model says that tomorrow, the system can move to the `up` state with probability $p$ or to the `down` state with probability $(1-p)$. \n",

    "Let's consider the case where we are modeling the potential future share price of an individual stock or an ETF, etc. Starting from time $t$ (now):\n",
    "* The `up` state at time $t+1$ has a share price of $S_{t+1}^{u} = u\\cdot{S}_{t}$, where $u$ is the up-factor and $S_{t}$ is the share price at time $t$.\n",
    "* The `down` state at time $t+1$ has a share price of $S_{t+1}^{d} = d\\cdot{S}_{t}$, where $d$ is the down-factor and $S_{t}$ is the share price at time $t$.\n",

    "__Because the future is uncertain__: we do not know exactly which future state we'll be in. For example, if we look at the `t = 3` level of the tree, we have `4` possible future states. We are not sure which of these four we'll be in, but because the binomial lattice model is discrete, we must be in one of these states."

    "There are several limitations of the binomial lattice model, let's look at two:\n",
    "* __Limited number of future states__: In a binomial lattice, the future is discretized into only two possible states, `up` or `down.` But what about unchanged? Further, the predicted future share price is limited to two discrete values governed by the $u$ and $d$ factors. What if these values do not reproduce the future share price?\n",
    "* __Lattice parameters are constant__: The $(u,d,p)$ parameters in the lattice model are assumed constant over the entire tree. This assumption allows for excellent analytical development, i.e., the binomial distribution. However, it fails to capture the changing dynamics of the asset or capture changing global market conditions. "
