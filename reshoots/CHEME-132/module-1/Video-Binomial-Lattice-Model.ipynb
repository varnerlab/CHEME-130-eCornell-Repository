    "## Binomial Lattice Model\n",
    " A binomial lattice model assumes that at each discrete time increment, the future state of the system, e.g., the share price of equity, can either increase by a factor $u$ with probability $p$ or decrease by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ in the next time interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we start today (the blue node), a binomial lattice model says that tomorrow, the system can move to the `up` state with probability $p$ or to the `down` state with probability $(1-p)$. \n",

    "Let's consider the case where we are modeling the potential future share price of an individual stock or an ETF, etc. Starting from time $t$ (now):\n",
    "* The `up` state at time $t+1$ has a share price of $S_{t+1}^{u} = u\\cdot{S}_{t}$, where $u$ is the up-factor and $S_{t}$ is the share price at time $t$.\n",
    "* The `down` state at time $t+1$ has a share price of $S_{t+1}^{d} = d\\cdot{S}_{t}$, where $d$ is the down-factor and $S_{t}$ is the share price at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Because the future is uncertain__: we do not know exactly which future state we'll be in. For example, if we look at the `t = 3` level of the tree, we have `4` possible future states. We are not sure which of these four we'll be in, but because the binomial lattice model is discrete, we must be in one of these states."
