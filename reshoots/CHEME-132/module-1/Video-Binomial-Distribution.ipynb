    "## Binomial Distributions\n",
    "The other discrete random variable that we are interested in is a binomial random variable, which is described by the Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Binomial Distribution__: Suppose we do a sequence of `n` Bernoulli trials. A binomial random variable governs the probability of getting `k` successes in `n`-independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

    "A Binomial distribution models the number of successes observed `k` in `n` Bernoulli trials. The probability mass function of a Binomial random variable is given by: \n",

    "p_{X}(k) = \\binom{n}{k}\\cdot{p}^{k}\\cdot\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k}\\qquad{k=0,1,\\dots,n}\n",

    "#### Expectation and Variance of a Binomial random variable\n",
    "Now, letâ€™s introduce expectation and variance for a Binomial random variable.\n",
    "The expectation $\\mathbb{E}\\left[X\\right]$ and variance $\\text{Var}\\left[X\\right]$ of a binomial random variable $X$ are given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}\\left[X\\right] &=& n\\cdot{p}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Var}\\left[X\\right] &=& n\\cdot{p}\\cdot(1-p)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The expectation of a binomial random variable is $n$ times $p$, and the variance is $n$ times $p$ times $(1-p)$. \n",
    "* __Key assumption__: One underlying assumption that will be important subsequently is that our trials are independent of one another. There's no memory from one trial to the next.  So, if I think about this just as a time sort of thing, I flip a coin, I reset, I flip a coin, I reset, I flip a coin. Each flip is independent of every other flip."
