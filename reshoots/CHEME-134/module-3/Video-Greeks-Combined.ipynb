    "## The Overview of the Greeks\n",
    "The option premium is a function of time $T$, underlying share price $S$, volatility $\\sigma$, and the risk-free rate $\\bar{r}$. [The Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Greeks_(finance)?variant=zh-tw) are metrics that can be used to understand how the premium of an option changes with market conditions. We'll explore the five common Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Rho.\n",
