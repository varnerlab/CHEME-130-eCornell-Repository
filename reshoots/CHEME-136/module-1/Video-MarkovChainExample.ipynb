    "### What does it mean when we sample $\\bar{\\pi}$ directly?\n",
    "A common source of confusion is the meaning of the stationary distribution $\\bar{\\pi}$. Suppose we don't care about our three-state random system's dynamics (time behavior). Instead, we are only interested in the steady-state behavior, i.e., the stationary distribution. In that case, we can sample $\\bar{\\pi}$ directly, but if we do that, we lose all the information about the transitions, i.e., all the time behavior. To explore this, consider the following thought experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Thought experiment__: Suppose our three-state model represented investor mood. We gathered `20` investors together in a focus group, isolated them, but gave them access to the same sources of information, and watched their mood for many rounds, i.e., as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$. The long-term mood of each investor would be samples from the stationary distribution $\\bar{\\pi}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this thought experiment. Create a [categorical distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution) using the stationary probability of our Markov chain using the [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) package, save this distribution in the variable `d`:"
