    "## Background\n",
    "[Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#STRIPS) are a unique type of fixed-income investment instrument that provides investors with an alternative way to access the income and coupon payments of Treasury securities. STRIPS bonds are created by separating a Treasury security’s coupon and principal components and trading them as individual zero-coupon securities. This process allows investors to purchase and trade the coupon or principal components separately, providing greater flexibility in managing their investment portfolios.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 5-year Treasury note with annual coupon payments of $C$ USD and a face (par) value of $V_{P}$ (USD) shown above can be stripped into six separate zero-coupon securities, i.e., five zero-coupon bonds, each with face values of $C$ and maturity of $T$= 1,2,3,4 and 5 years, and a six security with face  (par) value of $V_{P}$ USD with a duration of $T$ = 5 years. In the general case, a treasury note or bond with $N=\\lambda{T}$ coupon payments, where $T$ denotes the maturity in years, and $\\lambda$ represents the number of coupon payments per year, can be stripped into $N+1$ separate zero-coupon securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond thier immediate value as investment tools, STRIPS bonds are interesting as they provide another look at the [Term Structure of Interest Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20term%20structure%20of%20interest,current%20state%20of%20an%20economy), i.e., how the change in the [short rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-rate_model) influences the price and yeild the bond."

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this example, we will create a model for a 30-year treasury bond with semi-annual coupon payments. Then, we will strip the coupon payments and face value to produce 61 zero-coupon STRIPS bonds. We will then show the bootstrapping method, an alternative approach to estimating the short rates from the price of the STRIPS zero-coupon products.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Objective 1__: Our first objective is to build a model for a 30-year treasury bond and strip the bond's coupon payments and face value. To make our calculations realistic, we will use coupon and market interest values from recent 30-year bond quotations. We will encounter an interesting challenge when we strip the 30-year bond, which is how to price the zero-coupon STRIP products.\n",
    "* __Objective 2__: Our second objective is to demonstrate the bootstrapping method to estimate the short rates from the price of STRIP zero-coupon products."

    "STRIPS are often sold at discount compared to their face value because no coupon payments are made to holders. However, it’s important to note that the discount is determined by the seller in the secondary treasury market. To better understand this, let’s imagine a pricing scheme where we charge a varying percentage of the par value: \n",

    "$$V_{B} = \\alpha\\cdot{V}_{P}$$ \n",

Then, we iterate through the indexes of the zero-coupon bonds, retrieving the individual bond models from the `strips` dictionary using the bracket notation `strips[i]`, where `i` represents the bond index. Next, we access the duration (the `T` field of `MyUSTreasuryZeroCouponBondModel`) and the par value (the `par` field of `MyUSTreasuryZeroCouponBondModel`) of a bond, which we use to compute the discount parameter $\\alpha$ and the price of that bond.
