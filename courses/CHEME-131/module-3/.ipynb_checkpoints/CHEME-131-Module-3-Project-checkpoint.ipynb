    "## Background\n",
    "STRIPS bonds, short for [Registered Interest and Principal of Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#STRIPS) bonds, offer investors a unique fixed-income investment opportunity to access the income and coupon payments of Treasury securities. These bonds are created by separating a Treasury security’s coupon and principal components and trading them as zero-coupon securities. The separation process enables investors to purchase and trade the coupon or principal components individually, providing them with more flexibility in managing their investment portfolios.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 5-year Treasury note with annual coupon payments of $C$ USD and a face (par) value of $V_{P}$ (USD) shown above can be stripped into six separate zero-coupon securities, i.e., five zero-coupon bonds, each with face values of $C$ and maturity of $T$= 1,2,3,4 and 5 years, and a six security with face  (par) value of $V_{P}$ USD with a duration of $T$ = 5 years. In the general case, a treasury note or bond with $N=\\lambda{T}$ coupon payments, where $T$ denotes the maturity in years, and $\\lambda$ represents the number of coupon payments per year, can be stripped into $N+1$ separate zero-coupon securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond thier immediate value as investment tools, STRIPS bonds are interesting as they provide another look at the [Term Structure of Interest Rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termstructure.asp#:~:text=Essentially%2C%20term%20structure%20of%20interest,current%20state%20of%20an%20economy), i.e., how the change in the [short rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-rate_model) influences the price and yeild the bond."
