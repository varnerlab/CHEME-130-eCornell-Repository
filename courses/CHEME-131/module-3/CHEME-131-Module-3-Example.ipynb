    "## Background\n",
    "[Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#STRIPS) are a unique type of fixed-income investment instrument that provides investors with an alternative way to access the income and coupon payments of Treasury securities. STRIPS bonds are created by separating a Treasury security’s coupon and principal components and trading them as individual zero-coupon securities. This process allows investors to purchase and trade the coupon or principal components separately, providing greater flexibility in managing their investment portfolios."

    "For example, the 5-year Treasury note with annual coupon payments of $C$ USD and a face (par) value of $V_{P}$ (USD) shown above can be stripped into six separate zero-coupon securities, i.e., five zero-coupon bonds, each with face values of $C$ and maturity of $T$= 1,2,3,4 and 5 years, and a six security with face  (par) value of $V_{P}$ USD with a duration of $T$ = 5 years. In the general case, a treasury note or bond with $N=\\lambda{T}$ coupon payments, where $T$ denotes the maturity in years, and $\\lambda$ represents the number of coupon payments per year, can be stripped into $N+1$ separate zero-coupon securities.\n",

    "In this example, we will create a model for a 30-year treasury bond with semi-annual coupon payments. Then, we will strip the coupon payments and face value to produce 61 zero-coupon STRIPS bonds. We will then show the bootstrapping method, an alternative approach to estimating the short rates from the price of the STRIPS zero-coupon products.\n",

    "* __Objective 1__: Our first objective is to build a model for a 30-year treasury bond and strip the bond's coupon payments and face value. To make our calculations realistic, we will use coupon and market interest values from recent 30-year bond quotations. We will encounter an interesting challenge when we strip the 30-year bond, which is how to price the zero-coupon STRIP products.\n",
