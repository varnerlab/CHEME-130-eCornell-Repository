    "## Background\n",
    "Treasury notes, also known as T-notes, are financial instruments that offer a fixed interest rate every six months until they mature. These instruments are available for 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years and can be priced above or below their face (par) value. Upon maturity, lenders are entitled to the full par value of the note. T-notes are considered coupon debt instruments, meaning lenders receive regular interest payments based on a coupon rate throughout the note’s lifespan. \n",
    "\n",
    "Treasury bonds, like T-notes, are debt instruments that pay a fixed interest rate every six months. Unlike T-notes, however, Treasury bonds are long-term U.S. Treasury debt instruments with terms of 20 or 30 years. Once a bond reaches maturity, the bondholder receives its face value.  Notes and bonds can be held until maturity or sold before that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pricing\n",
    "Let the term of a bond (or note) be T-years with  $\\lambda$ coupon payments per year; $N = \\lambda{T}$ coupon payments over the bond term. Further, let $\\bar{c}$ denote the annualized coupon rate, and $\\bar{r}$ denote the annual effective market rate of interest. Then, the _fair price_ for the bond (or note) $V_{B}$ is the present value of coupon payments $C$ plus the discounted face (par) value $V_{P}$ of the bond:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{B} = \\mathcal{D}^{-1}_{N}V_{P}+\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\mathcal{D}_{j}^{-1}C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{D}_{i}$ denotes the discount factor for time period $0\\rightarrow{i}$ which can be either a discrete or continuous compouning model. \n",
    "The coupon payment $C=\\left(\\bar{c}/\\lambda\\right)\\cdot{V_{P}}$ is set when the bond is purchased, and the interest rate $i=\\bar{r}/\\lambda$ varies with the market (set at auction). The contract between the U.S. government, the issuer, and the bondholder (you) includes the bond’s coupon rate, maturity date, and face (par) value."

    "## Objective 2: Computing the Yield to Maturity (YTM) for treasury notes and bonds\n",
    "Mathematically, the Yield to Maturity (YTM) of a treasury note or bond is the internal rate of return (IRR) associated with buying and holding the security until its maturity date. The YTM and the effective market interest rate are equal when the note or bond is initially auctioned (primary market). However, notes and bonds can be resold on the [secondary treasury market](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/08/treasuries-fed.asp#:~:text=For%20many%20people%2C%20TreasuryDirect%20is,convenience%20and%20liquidity%20than%20TreasuryDirect), potentially _after_ some of the coupon payments have been paid out. In these cases, the yield to maturity is _not equal_ to the initial market interest rate at auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario\n",
    "Assume a discrete discounting model. To better understand the YTM, let’s consider a scenario where we purchased a 5-year treasury note with a face value of $V_{P}$ = 100 USD at auction for $V_{B}$ = 96.82 USD. The note has an annual coupon rate of 6%, with semi-annual coupons. We then resell the T-note on the secondary market after holding it for $T^{\\prime}$ years (and collecting some coupon payments) for the same price we paid."
