    "## Background\n",
    "Treasury bills, otherwise known as T-Bills, are financial instruments with short-term due dates ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. They are fixed-income investments with zero coupons, meaning no coupon payments are made during the term. Instead, the price of treasury bills is calculated so that the bill receiver gets the face (par) value ($V_{P}$) at the end of the term. \n",

    "### Pricing\n",
    "A zero-coupon T-bill with an annual effective market interest rate $\\bar{r}$, which is specified at the time of purchase, and a term of T years has a _fair price_ of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{B} = \\mathcal{D}_{T,0}^{-1}\\cdot{V_{P}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{D}_{T}$ denotes the discount factor from the time of the auction to the term of T-bill, i.e., $0\\rightarrow{T}$. Typically, a constant averaged rate of interest is used to compute the discount factor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{D}_{T,0} = (1+\\bar{r})^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, dynamic formulations of the discount factor with period-specific interest rates can also be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{D}_{T,0} = \\left[\\prod_{j=0}^{T-1}\\left(1+r_{j+1,j}\\right)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_{j+1,j}$ terms are called short rates, i.e., the interest rate earned between period $j\\rightarrow{j+1}$. Treasury bills are released for specific periods $T=$ 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. The fair price $V_{B}$ of the T-bill is the future face value $V_{P}$ that is discounted to today’s value by the effective market interest rate $\\bar{r}$, which is assumed constant over the lifetime of the treasury bill."

    "## Project\n",
    "You purchased a 52-week T-bill with a par value $V_{P}=100.0$ USD and an effective market rate of interest $\\bar{r}$ (annualized). However, four weeks (28-days) after purchasing the T-bill, the interest rate is now $\\bar{r}^{\\prime}$. Should you `sell` the T-bill before it matures or `hold` the T-bill to term?\n",

    " 1. Load, and analyze historical T-bill interest rate data sets from 2019 to 2023 computed daily by [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org). Store these data in a [Dictionary](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries) where the year, e.g., `\"2022\"` are the keys and the data sets of the values. \n",
