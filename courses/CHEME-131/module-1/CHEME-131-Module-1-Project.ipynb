    "## Introduction\n",
    "Treasury bills, or T-bills, are debt instruments with short-term maturity periods ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-bills are zero-coupon fixed-income investments, i.e., no coupon payments are paid during their term. Instead, treasury bills are priced so that the bill holder receives the par value $V_{P}$ at the end of the term. A zero-coupon T-bill with an annual market interest rate of $\\bar{r}$, specified at the time of purchase, and a T-year term has the fair price:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{B} = \\frac{V_{P}}{\\left(1+\\bar{r}\\right)^{T}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fair price $V_{B}$ of the treasury bill is the future par value $V_{P}$ of the T-bill discounted to today by the market interest rate $\\bar{r}$. Treasury bills are issued for specific periods, such as 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks."

    "## Scenario\n",
    "You purchased a 52-week T-bill with a par value $V_{P}=1000$ USD and interest rate $\\bar{r}$. However, four weeks (28-days) after purchasing the T-bill, the interest rate is now $\\bar{r}^{\\prime}$. Should you `sell` the T-bill before it matures or `hold` the T-bill to term?"
