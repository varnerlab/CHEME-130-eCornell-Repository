    "## Background\n",
    "Treasury bills, or T-bills, are debt instruments with short-term maturity periods ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-bills are zero-coupon fixed-income investments, i.e., no coupon payments are paid during their term. Instead, treasury bills are priced so that the bill holder receives the par value $V_{P}$ at the end of the term. A zero-coupon T-bill with an annual market interest rate of $\\bar{r}$, specified at the time of purchase, and a T-year term has the fair price:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{B} = \\frac{V_{P}}{\\left(1+\\bar{r}\\right)^{T}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fair price $V_{B}$ of the treasury bill is the future par value $V_{P}$ of the T-bill discounted to today by the market interest rate $\\bar{r}$. Treasury bills are issued for specific periods, such as 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks."

    "Compute the fair price of 4-week and 52-week treasury bills using historical interest rate data gathered daily from 2019 to 2023:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the quoted annualized market interest rate $\\bar{r}$, show that the fair price of a 52-week T-bill is more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than a 4-week T-bill with the same par value.\n",
    "1. Using a binomial lattice model estimated from historical data, compute how the price of a 4-week and 52-week T-bill change between the time of purchase and the bond term."
