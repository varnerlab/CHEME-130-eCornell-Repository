    "### Introduction\n",
    "Treasury bills, or T-bills, are debt instruments with short-term maturity periods ranging from a few days to 52 weeks. T-bills are zero-coupon fixed-income investments, i.e., no coupon payments are paid during their term. Instead, treasury bills are priced so that the bill holder receives the par value $V_{P}$ at the end of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "A zero-coupon T-bill has an annual market interest rate of $\\bar{r}$, specified at the time of purchase, and a T-year term. The fair price of the treasury bill is the future face (par) value discounted to today by the market interest rate $\\bar{r}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_{B} = \\frac{V_{P}}{\\left(1+\\bar{r}\\right)^{T}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity $V_{B}$ denotes the current price, and $V_{P}$ represents the par (face) value of the T-bill.  Treasury bills are issued for specific periods, such as 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks."

    "### Scenario\n",
    "You purchased a 52-week T-bill with a par value $V_{P}=1000$ USD and interest rate $\\bar{r}$. However, four weeks (28-days) after purchasing the T-bill, the interest rate is now $\\bar{r}^{\\prime}$. Should you `sell` the T-bill before it matures or `hold` the T-bill to term?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks \n",
    " 1. Load, analyze and visualize historical T-bill interest rate data sets from 2019 to 2023 computed daily by [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://www.newyorkfed.org). Store these data in a [Dictionary](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Dictionaries) where the year, e.g., `\"2022\"` are the keys and the data sets of the values. \n",
    " 1. Develop a strategy to decide between a `hold` or `sell` action for your T-bill.\n",
    " 1. Backtest your stratetgy using historical interest rate data for 52-week T-bills\n",
    "     1. Implement your strategy and compute the number of sucess and failures of strategy"

    "### Setup\n",
    "The `Include.jl` file loads [Julia functions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/) and [problem specific types](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/) that will be helpful for the analysis of T-bill pricing. In addition, `Include.jl` loads several external packages that we will use for our excercise:\n",
    "* [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) provides a set of tools for working with tabular data in [Julia](https://julialang.org). Its design and functionality are similar to those of [Pandas (in Python)](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [data.frame, data.table and dplyr (in R)](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), making it a great general purpose data science tool."

This project has data from `\"2019\"`, `\"2020\"`, `\"2021\"`, `\"2022\"` and `\"2022\"`. The year parameter has a default value of `\"2022\"`.\n",
    "* The `build(model::Type{MyUSTreasuryBillModel}, data::NamedTuple) -> MyUSTreasuryBillModel` function takes information in the `data` arguement (the par value, the rate and the duration of the T-bill) and returns an instance of the `MyUSTreasuryBillModel` custom type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types\n",
    "* `MyUSTreasuryBillModel` is a [mutable type](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Mutable-Composite-Types) holding the par value $V_{P}$, the duration $T$ and the interest rate $\\bar{r}$ for a zero-coupon treasury bill. You construct a `MyUSTreasuryBillModel` instance using the `build` method described above."
