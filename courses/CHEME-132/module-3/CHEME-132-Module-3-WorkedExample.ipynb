    "# Example: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Simulation of Historical Price Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "[Geometric Brownian motion (GBM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) is a continuous-time stochastic process model in which the random variable $X(t)$, e.g., the share price of `XYZ` is described by a deterministic drift corrupted by a [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dX}{X} = {\\mu}dt + \\sigma{dW}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\mu$ denotes a drift parameter, $\\sigma$ indicates a volatility parameter, and $dW$ represents the output of a [Wiener process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical solution\n",
    "Using [Ito's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It√¥%27s_lemma), you can formulate an analytical solution to the GBM equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(t) = X_{\\circ}\\exp\\Biggl[\\left(\\mu-\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)\\left(t - t_{\\circ}\\right) + (\\sigma\\sqrt{t-t_{\\circ}})Z(0,1)\\Biggr]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X_{\\circ}$ denotes the initial price at $t_{\\circ}$, and $Z(0,1)$ denotes a [standard normal random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Standard_normal_distribution). "

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Objective 1__: First, we'll estimate values for the drift $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ parameters that appear in the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) analytical solution from historical data.\n",
    "* __Objective 2__: Second we'll compare model predictions of share price for unseen data, e.g., out-of-sample data against observed market values."

    "The `Include.jl` file loads several packages that we use'll for our exercises:\n",
    "* [Dates.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/#Dates)  is a package included with the standard library which provides basic functionality for working dates.\n",
    "* [DataFrames.jl](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/) and [CSV.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl) provide a set of tools for working with tabular data in [Julia](https://julialang.org). Its design and functionality are similar to those of [Pandas (in Python)](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [data.frame, data.table and dplyr (in R)](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), making it an excellent general-purpose data science tool.\n",
    "* [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package for probability distributions and associated functions.\n",
    "* [PrettyTables.jl](https://ronisbr.github.io/PrettyTables.jl/stable/man/html_backend/) is a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package that implements functions to construct and display text-based tables\n",
    "* [Plots.jl](https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/) is a plotting library, and [Colors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl) is a color library that we'll use for data visualization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).\n",
    "* [LinearAlgebra.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/LinearAlgebra.jl) is a package that provides functionality for working with linear algebra in [Julia](https://julialang.org).\n",
    "* [Statistics.jl](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/#Statistics) is a package included with the standard library module, which contains basic statistics functionality"
