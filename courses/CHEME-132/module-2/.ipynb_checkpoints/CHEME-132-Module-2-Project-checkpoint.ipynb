    "# Project: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Models and Stylized Facts\n",
    "Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is widely used as a pricing model. However, whether GBM replicates many of the statistical properties of actual pricing and return data is unclear. \n",
    "* These properties, referred to as _stylized facts_ have been observed for decades, dating back to early work by [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot) and later in several studies by [Rama Cont](http://rama.cont.perso.math.cnrs.fr/pdf/empirical.pdf) and more recently by [Ratliff-Crain et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07738) who reviewed the 11 original stylized facts proposed by [Cont](http://rama.cont.perso.math.cnrs.fr/pdf/empirical.pdf) with newer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "In this project, students will examine a few of the statistical properties (stylized facts) of return data and explore how well geometric Brownian motion models replicate these properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "* __Prerequisite__: Load and clean the historical dataset. The data we'll explore is daily open-high-low-close values for firms in the [S&P500 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) between `01-03-2018` and `12-29-2023`.\n",
    "* __Objective 1__: Are the returns in dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ actually Laplace distributed?\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Estimate the return data for firms in dataset $\\mathcal{D}$\n",
    "    * `TODO`: Classify the returns of firm $i$ as $c_{i}\\in\\left\\{\\text{normal},\\text{laplace},\\text{undefined}\\right\\}$\n",
