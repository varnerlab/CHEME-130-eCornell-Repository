    "# Example: Binomial Lattice Models of Equity Share Price\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "A binomial lattice model assumes that each discrete time increment, the state of the system, e.g., the share price of equity, the short rate, etc., can either increase by a factor $u$ with probability $p$ or decrease by a factor $d$ with probability $(1-p)$ in the next time interval. Thus, each discrete time interval can be modeled as a [Bernoulli random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution):\n",

    "Different models have been developed to compute the tuple $(u,d,p)$. However, for now, let's analyze historical data and learn typical values governing the price movement for each firm in the . Thus, we’ll take an approach similar to the short-rate calculations discussed previously. "

    "After validating our lattice implementation, it's time to utilize historical data to compute a share price prediction. To create a binomial lattice model for future share prices, we need to model or estimate three critical parameters: $p$, $u$, and $d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $p$ parameter represents the probability of a share price increase or an `up` move between two periods $j\\rightarrow{j+1}$. As a binary lattice model only allows `up` and `down` moves, the probability of a `down` move is $1-p$.\n",
    "* The $u$ parameter represents the amount of an `up` move. If $S_{j}$ stands for the share price in period $j$, and $S_{j+1}$ is the share price in the next period, then an `up` move will give $S_{j+1} = u\\cdot{S}_{j}$.\n",

We then populate the `return_array` using a `for` loop; during each pass through the loop, we get values for $S_{j-1}$ and $S_{j}$, i.e., the VWAP for the two days from the dataset `df`, and then we compute (and store) the annualized value of $\\mu_{j,j-1}$ parameter in the `return_array`:"
