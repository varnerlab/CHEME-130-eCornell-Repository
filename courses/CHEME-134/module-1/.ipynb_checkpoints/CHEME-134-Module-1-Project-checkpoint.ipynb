    "# Project: Understanding the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value of Options Premium\n",
    "The premium that a buyer of an American options contract pays $\\mathcal{P}$ is composed of two components, the `intrinsic` value $\\mathcal{P}_{int}$ and `extrinsic` value $\\mathcal{P}_{ext}$:\n",
    "* The `intrinsic` value $\\mathcal{P}_{int}$ of the options premium is the value of the option contract if it were exercised now, i.e., it is the current payoff of the contract.\n",
    "* The `extrinsic` value $\\mathcal{P}_{ext}$ is the difference between the current premium $\\mathcal{P}$ and the intrinsic value, i.e., $\\mathcal{P}_{ext} = \\mathcal{P} - \\mathcal{P}_{int}$. As the days to expiration `DTE` of the options contract approaches zero, the `extrinsic` value approaches zero, i.e., $\\lim_{DTE\\rightarrow{0}}\\,\\mathcal{P}_{ext}\\rightarrow{0}$.\n",

    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "The objective of this project is to familiarize students with understanding the `intrinsic` and `extrinsic` values of options contracts, and think about what factors control each of these values."
