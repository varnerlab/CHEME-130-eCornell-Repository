    "# Example: Modeling the Price of European Call or Put Contracts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "A `call` option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified asset, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies, at a predetermined price within a specified time period. Let's consider stock as the underlying asset. A single standard `put` contract controls `100` shares of stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business case for buying (or selling) a `call` contract:\n",
    "* __Buyer (long)__: From the buyer's perspective, call contracts allow an investor to benefit from the price movement of `XYZ` to the upside _without_ purchasing `XYZ`. Further, call options (again from the buyer's perspective) have _limited downside risk_, i.e., the maximum amount that the holder of the call option can lose is the premium paid for the option. Finally, call options are a mechanism to purchase shares of `XYZ` at the strike price of $K$ instead of the market price of $S$. \n",
    "* __Seller (short)__: From the seller's perspective, the main objective of selling a call contract is to collect the premium $\\mathcal{P}$. Call contracts also allow the seller to benefit from the price movement of `XYZ` to the downside _without_ purchasing `XYZ`. However, for a seller, call options have _unlimted upside_ risk; thus, call options are often only sold by investors who already own the required number of shares of `XYZ` (known as a [covered call position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp)). Finally, call options offer the seller the opportunity to sell shares of `XYZ` at the strike price of $K$ instead of the market price of $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `put` option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified asset, such as stocks, commodities, or currencies, at a predetermined price within a specified time period.

However, for a seller, `put` options have _unlimted downside_ risk; thus, `put` options are often only sold by investors who have set aside the required capital to purchase the required number of shares of `XYZ` (known as a [cash secured put position](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/know-about-cash-covered-puts)). Finally, `put` options offer the seller the opportunity to buy shares of `XYZ` at the strike price of $K-\\mathcal{P}$ instead of the market price of $S$.\n",
